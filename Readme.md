# Alternative Solutions to Codecademys Recursion Challenges with Pythonn## The task was to remove the ith element from a linked list with recursionn### The Code contains the expected solution, which doesnt manipulate the linekd list at all, an alternative solution that  changes the linkedlist with iteration and finally an alternative solution that changes the linked list with recursion - no looking at computing efficiency though.
