# Alternative Solutions to Codecademy's Recursion Challenges with Pythonn

#### Task Description:
The task was to remove the ith element from a linked list with recursionn

#### Solutions:

1. First solution expected/given on Codecademy:
The Code contains the expected solution, which doesn't manipulate the linked list at all. It only returns a list with the removed element, but the orignal data stays the same and the result is delivered in a different data structure, python list instead of linked list, which siplifies the  tasks significantly.

2. Second solution:
An alternative solution that  changes the linkedlist with iteration 

3. Third solution:
Finally an alternative solution that changes the linked list with recursion - not looking at computing efficiency yet.
